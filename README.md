# Deriviste

Deriviste is a proof-of-concept OpenStreetMap editor for adding POIs directly from street-level imagery (Mapillary).
Ok, it's not really an editor as you can't edit anything, only create.

Deriviste is written in largely prehistoric JavaScript and is licensed WTFPL with no warranty.
Patches are lovely. Please send patches.

You can see it live at https://osm.cycle.travel/deriviste/.
